    "Described with simple words, [Green's functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function) are elementary solutions of linear differential equations that allow one to construct a full solution of the problem using the superposition principle (also called [convolution](https://sites.google.com/site/butwhymath/m/convolution)). \n",
    "\n",
    "These functions also go by the name of impulse response (see an [excellent article by John D. Cook](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/10/20/impulse-response/) for a good physical explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things I like about this is that Green's functions are a cornerstone of many things I'm interested in: physics (the problem to be solved), Fourier transforms (that's often the way you sum solutions), and convolutions.\n",

    "The outline of the article is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- description of our sample problem: the 1D wave equation / the harmonic oscillator\n",
    "- intuition about what a Green's function is (the impulse response)\n",
    "- summing over solutions using the convolution theorem"
